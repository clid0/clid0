# Hey there, I'm Jiwu. I'm also known as cliid.

[cliid.dev](https://cliid.dev) is my website.<br />
I built it with `@next` and `contentlayer`.

What I'm doing now:
- Thinking how `Free/Libre Software` can enhance user's freedoms.
- Reading `<A Theory of Justice>` by John Rawls.
- Building a decentralized version of Open Collective.
