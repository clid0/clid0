# Hey there, I'm Jiwu Jang.
## I'm the co-founder of @dazzleofficial. I love C++ and TypeScript, and travelling too.
### Oh, and I'm also known as cliid.

My best travel was when I went to Europe for 80 days. <br />
You can see my travel map in here: [Jiwu's travel map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1hRaSvquUyw5424PjryJYQZiRjyv8ORwe&usp=sharing)

I once lived in Evanston, IL, and now I'm in Seoul, Korea, as you can see in my profile.

[This](https://cliid.dev) is my website.<br />
I built it with `@next`, `preact`, `tailwindcss`, `@prisma/client`, `fuse.js`, `next-pwa`, `next-auth`, and `contentlayer`.

By the way, I also enjoy competitive programming.

- ‚úèÔ∏èÔ∏è Thinking how `free market capitalism` can improve our society in terms of cost-benefit analysis.
- üå± Learning various methods of web optimizations including SEO optimization, FCP / LCP / TTFB optimization, and more.
- üìñ Reading `The Machinery of Freedom` written by `David Friedman`

Here are my list of e-mails: <br />
