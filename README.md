# Hey there, I'm Jiwu Jang.
## I'm the co-founder of @dazzleofficial. I love C++ and TypeScript, and travelling too.
### Oh, and I'm also known as cliid.

My best travel was when I went to Europe for 80 days. <br />
You can see my travel map in here: [Jiwu's travel map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1hRaSvquUyw5424PjryJYQZiRjyv8ORwe&usp=sharing)

I once lived in Evanston, IL, and now I'm in Seoul, Korea, as you can see in my profile.

[This](https://cliid.dev) is my website.<br />
I built it with React, Next.JS, TailwindCSS, Prisma, Fuse.js, Next-PWA, NextAuth, and Contentlayer.

By the way, I also enjoy competitive programming.

- ‚úèÔ∏èÔ∏è Thinking how `anarcho-capitalism` (or also known as `free market capitalism`) can improve our society using cost-benefit analysis.
- üå± Learning how to build a blazingly fast, yet feature-rich web application using Next.JS.
  - Also learning various methods of web app optimization.
- üìñ Reading `The Machinery of Freedom` written by `David Friedman`
